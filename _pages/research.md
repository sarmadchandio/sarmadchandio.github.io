Computational audits of social media websites have generated data that forms the basis of our understanding of the problematic behaviors of algorithmic recommendation systems. However, these audits at times show contradictory results. Focusing on YouTube, researchers have demonstrated the algorithm's tendency to reinforce and amplify problematic views, contrastingly studies have also established an equally viable but opposite mainstreaming effect, suggesting that the algorithm does not reinforce such views. One reason for these conflicting findings is the complexity involved in designing these audits. This paper demonstrates that conducting sock-puppet audits to make specific inferences about the underlying content recommendation system is more methodologically challenging than one might expect, with slight changes in the audit design leading to drastic changes in the findings.

<!-- Social Media Radicationzation -->
<p style="margin-bottom:-25px; font-size:24px; font-family:Forum; font-weight:bold;"> The Effect of Using Social Media on Abortion Attitudes | Working</p>
<br/>
Alongside traditional news, social media serves as a crucial source of news and information regarding contentious issues such as abortion. What sets social media apart from traditional news is its tendency  tendency to create a filter bubble around one's own opinions. This tendency varies across different platforms. In a logitudinal survey, we collect the opinions of individuals on abortion in two waves, distanced a year apart (2021-2022). We also collect their behavioral data usage during this time frame to have a complete picture of their consumption pattern in this time frame. Using both the data sources, we compare the social media histories of various users to quantify the influence of various social media in swaying user opinions.

<!-- Data Voids -->
<p style="margin-bottom:-25px; font-size:24px; font-family:Forum; font-weight:bold;"> Systematically Detecting Data Voids | Working</p>
<br/>
Information seeking users rely on intuition, attracting them to a particular information source, to seek answers online. Malicious actors strategically fill up the gaps of information in the online information space called [data voids](https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/) leading vulnerable users to misinformation. In this work we are designing infrastrucutres to systematically detect exploitative data voids on the internet.

<!-- Online Volunteer Moderators -->
<p style="margin-bottom:-25px; font-size:24px; font-family:Forum; font-weight:bold;"> The Effect of Monetary Incentives on the Behavior of Online Content Moderators | Thinking</p>
<br/>
Online _volunteer_ content moderators keep the internet clean. But are they volunteering or being exploited? Focusing on Reddit moderators, this work aims to understand the intrinsic motivation of them volunteering by quantitatively measuring the change in their behavior for different monetray incentives.
