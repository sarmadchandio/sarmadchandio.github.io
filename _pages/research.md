Computational audits of social media websites have generated data that forms the basis of our understanding of the problematic behaviors of algorithmic recommendation systems. Focusing on YouTube, this paper demonstrates that conducting audits to make specific inferences about the underlying content recommendation system is more methodologically challenging that one might expect.

<!-- Data Voids -->
<p style="margin-bottom:-25px; font-size:24px; font-family:Forum; font-weight:bold;"> Systematically Detecting Data Voids | Working</p>
<br/>
A user is most vulnerable when finding information online. Malicious actors strategically fill up the gaps of information in the online information space called [data voids](https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/) leading vulnerable users to misinformation. In this work we are designing infrastrucutres to systematically detect exploitative data voids on the internet.

<!-- Online Volunteer Moderators -->
<p style="margin-bottom:-25px; font-size:24px; font-family:Forum; font-weight:bold;"> The Effect of Monetary Incentives on the Behavior of Online Content Moderators | Thinking</p>
<br/>
Online _volunteer_ content moderators keep the internet clean. But are they volunteering or being exploited? Focusing on Reddit moderators, this work aims to understand the intrinsic motivation of them volunteering by quantitatively measuring the change in their behavior for different monetray incentives.
