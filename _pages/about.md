Hi, I am Sarmad, a third year PhD student at the University of Iowa advised by [Dr. Rishab Nithyanand](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/people/rishab/). I am a member of Algorithmic Personalization & Society and a research assistant at [SPARTA lab](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/).


I use computational social science theories with a focus on platform governance, and online manipulation. I spend my time doing this:
- building infrastructures to audit platforms and uncover emergent effects of recommendation systems on users.
- investigating the behavioural efforts of online volunteer moderators on platforms.
- understanding how users radicalize on YouTube.
- systematically detecting [data voids](https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/).
