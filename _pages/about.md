Hi! I am Sarmad, a fourth year PhD student at the University of Iowa advised by [Dr. Rishab Nithyanand](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/people/rishab/). I am a member of Algorithmic Personalization & Society and a research assistant at [SPARTA lab](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/).


Using computational social science techniques I study how social media platforms affect user ideologies. This involves developing methods to identify bias propagation through recommendation systems and measure how this bias plays a role in shaping user opinions.
