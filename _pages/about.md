Hi, I am Sarmad, a third year PhD student at the University of Iowa advised by [Dr. Rishab Nithyanand](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/people/rishab/). I am a member of Algorithmic Personalization & Society and a research assistant at [SPARTA lab](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/).


I use a combination of algorithmic auditing, natural language processing, and social science theories to study platform governance, and online manipulation. Recently, I have developed an interest in how user platform interaction leads to change in ideologies.
