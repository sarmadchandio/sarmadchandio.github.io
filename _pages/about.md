I am second year PhD student at the University of Iowa in Computer Science working in the [SPARTA lab](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/) advised by [Rishab Nithyanand](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/people/rishab/). I work in computational social science focusing on content moderation. I have done work in finding systematic ways to audit different platforms.
